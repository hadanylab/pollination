CM_runner is the main file that runs the program

it draws the CM borders without prettifying and on it draws the fc graphs, for analysis

after then you can close the figure and use format_fc_graphs again to plot it separately

init_params = basic parameters
draw_CM_borders = just to draw the pollinator behavior borders
format_fc_graphs = formatting final graphs
